Packet switching vs circuit switching
  - No individually allocated channel, instead packet switching has one
    channel that everyone shares by sending packets
  - Pros: Packet switching is more much efficient in resource allocation
    - Essentially, with 100% reliability, packet switching and circuit switching
      support the same; but packet switching may support additional users
      with lower probability of full reliability (statistical multiplexing)
    - This also allows an individual user to temporarily send more during
      down periods for others
  - Cons: Excessive congestion is possible, can lead to packet loss
    - Circuit switching is better for specific applicable use with predictable usage
    - Packet switching is better when the use cases are dynamic, and usage is unknown

Network Core
  - Routing
  - Forwarding

Packet Switching
  Packet structure
    - Sender has destination's IP address in every packet sends
    - Router when it receives a packet, looks up the destination IP address in
      a "forwarding table" to figure out where to send it out to
    - Every router has its own forwarding table, and only stores local links to
      send it out to, specific for that router
  Store-and-forward: Entire packet must arrive at router before forwarding
    - Propagation delay

Delays (Nodal delay)
  Queueing
    - When more incoming traffic than bandwidth of the link, then packets will
      queue up
    - If the memory (buffer) fills up on the router, then packets are dropped/lost
    - This is the only type of delay that can vary packet to packet (given all packets are the same size),
      dependent on the size of the queue
  Transmission - Putting packet onto link (L/R)
  Propagation - Packet traveling the link (e.g higher for undersea links)
    - Between when first bit sent and then received
  Processing - Putting packet into queue (checking for errors, looking up which
    link to transmit it out, etc)

Traceroute
  - Uses TTL (Time to live) to measure the path
    - TTL is used in case if there is a network loop, where it would eventually
      throw out the packet rather than permanently circulate through internet
  - When the router throws back the error message (bc TTL reached 0), it reveals
    the router that errored out; hence traceroute just sends out the same
    packet with incremental TTL to trace out the whole path the packet took
