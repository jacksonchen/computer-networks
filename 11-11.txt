IPv6 adoption is very slow

Getting IP Address
  - ISP is able to sub-allocate blocks to organization customers
    - Internet uses longest matching IP prefix (i.e most specific route) to determine route
  - How do individual hosts get IP addresses?
    - Hard coded by system admin in a file
    - DHCP (dynamically get address from a server)
      - New client first broadcasts a request to find a DHCP server (it doesn't
        know the DHCP server's IP) -> broadcast = send to everyone on the network
      - DHCP server responds with an IP address that is available for use;
        the transaction ID is in case if multiple requests come in at the same time,
        DHCP is able to distinguish each one

Inside IPv4 datagram
  - Transport protocol is the glue between the transport and network layer
  - Port number is the glue between network and application layer
  - Note that every layer needs some bit of information to tell what to send to
    in the above layer

================

Control plane
  - Can be done per router, or done by software network-wide (logically centralized)

How are Forwarding Tables maintained?
  - Routing protocol goal: Determine "good" paths
    - Policy considerations (lowest cost; not routing traffic through unrelated organizations)
  - Routing algorithms
    - Autonomous systems (AS), where you have intra-AS routing (all routers in AS running same
      AS protocol)
      - For Intra-AS routing protocols, we will look at OSPF
