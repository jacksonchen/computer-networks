Content distribution networks and video streaming
  - Video consists of most of the Internet bandwidth
  - Heterogenity of users (users with different bandwidth capabilities)
  - Solution: Application-level infrastructure

  - How to send video
    - Since video is a sequence of frames (images), could use redundancy between
      images to decrease # bits used to encode image
      - i.e send only differences between frames
    - VBR: Variable bitrate (to capture differences, sometimes very little difference
      other times drastic changes between frames)
    - DASH
      - Server divides video files in to chunks, encoded at different rates,
        and provides manifest file for URLs for different chunks
      - Client would measure server-to-client bandwidth, and requests chunk at a time
        at the maximum coding rate sustainable
        - Flexible, since client can choose different coding rates at different points in time
        - Client holds "intelligence" for when and what encoding rate to request
    - CDN
      - Store multiple copies of video chunks at multiple geographically distributed sites,
        or places with high available bandwidth
      - Enter deep CDN: Push these CDN servers into many access networks (close to users)
      - Bring home CDN: Smaller number of CDN's, but put in more populated interconnection
        points with lots of users (POP - Point of Presence)

      - OTT
        - When user requests video, they sent to Netflix central servers, which send back
          a manifest of the location of the closest server with that video
          - The user then directly streams from that server
      - How to direct client to particular CDN server? (not in book)
        - Customized hostnames
          - Pro: Straightforward to get exact mapping you want
          - Cons: Not relevant on first page
        - DNS redirection
          - Authoritative DNS resolver will give IP address that it wants you to go to
          - Authoritative resolver will communicate with client's LDNS and give the client
            the IP of the closest server
          - DNS pitfall: Only bases off location of LDNS, which can serve clients in
            very different locations
        - Anycast
          - Very simple, relies on Internet routing
          - This is also a con, since much less precise control
            - Server switches will break TCP connections
