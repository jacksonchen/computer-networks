Cloud and servers are the edge of the internet
  - Us, users, are the core of the Internet

DSL
  - Central Office serving a region with phone lines
  - DSL modem in the home that takes digital transmissions from computers and other
    devices into high frequency analog tones that phone wires transmit
    - In the central office, the DSLAM takes the analog tones from the modem and
      converts it back into digital data to send out to the internet
  - Each house has a dedicated wire

Cable Network
  - Also have cable modem, very similar to DSL
  - Headend (instead of central office)
  - Main difference is all houses in a neighborhood have a shared wire rather
    than each home having a dedicated wire
  - Uses HFC (hybrid fiber coax) cable

Ethernet
  - Good at providing very high speeds over short distances, good for enterprises
    and institutions
    - Not good for homes since they are spread far apart

Fiber
  - Free of electromagnetic interference, able to carry signals across long distances

Wireless & Radio
  - How to reliably transmit data across unreliable networks?

Internet Structure
  - Customer - provider relationships with global ISP having connections with
    access networks
  - Multiple global ISP's for competition; the global ISP's connect to each
    other through "peering links"
  - Internet Exchange Point (IXP) that connect multiple global ISP's (multiple
    peering links leave IXP's)
    - Connecting to the exchange point, connects you to everything else connected to the IXP
  - Also regional networks, if a global ISP is not needed for scope
  - Content provider network (e.g Google, Netflix)
    - Gives more control, cheaper operations
    - Delivers more quickly, faster distribution across the world

Circuit Switching
  - Each connection between routers, the entire line is reserved to the connection.
  - Frequency Division Multiplexing or Time Division Multiplexing
  - Very inefficient because unused allocation is not used by anyone
