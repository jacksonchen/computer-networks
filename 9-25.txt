Caching
  - Currently, content delivery network is the most commonly used cache
  - Get request
    - Header request has a "if-modified-since" to check if cache is up to date
    - If satisfied = no object transmission delay and lower link utilization

Electronic mail
  - Messages stored on mail servers
  - Uses SMTP to communicate between user agents and mail servers
    - Sender and receiver operate in an asynchronous manner
    - The addition of a mail server allows for the asynchronity
  - Mail server
    - Newly outgoing mail gets added to a queue (message queue)
      - This mail gets sent to the recipient's mail server
    - Incoming mail to mail server gets stored in the user's inbox
  - SMTP
    - Uses TCP either for sending from client to server (mail server) or server to recipient
    - Runs on port 25
    - Direct transfer in three phases:
      - Handshake
      - Transfer of Messages
      - Closure
    - Messages must be in 7-bit ASCII -- even if user includes special font etc,
      it must be converted to ASCII before being sent out
    - Persistent connection
    - Push based protocol (compare this to HTTP which is pull based with each
      object as a request-response transaction)
  - Slide 70
    - When you check the mail via a user agent (step 6), what protocol do you use?
      - SMTP isn't actually a protocol for checking mail
      - HTTP can be used, esp since the mail server has a well known DNS
        (Gmail, Yahoo Mail, etc)
      - POP, IMAP can also be used
        - IMAP more features including manipulation of stored messages on server
    - Also note that sending mail to the mail server (step 2) could also use HTTP to send the message
      (e.g Gmail)
    - Conclusion: Step 2 COULD be SMTP, but Step 6 can NOT be SMTP
  - RFC 822 standard for mail message format

POP3 vs IMAP
  - POP3
    - Authorization phase (client sends user and password)
    - Transaction phase (retrieve messages, delete, quit)
  - POP clients cannot re-read email if client is changed
  - POP: Stateless across sessions
  - IMAP keeps user state across sessions (names of folders and mappings
    between message IDs and folder name)

At the protocol level, there's nothing to prevent spoofing (of sender)
  - Common way to prevent this is for server itself to check

========== Domain Name System (DNS)

Why DNS?
  - IP addresses change, but the audience may not necessarily know or care

DNS
  - Implemented at the application layer protocol
