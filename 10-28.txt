Network Layer
  - Transport layer only deals with the end hosts, while the network layer deals
    with everything in between
    - Every host in between sending and receiving side (e.g routers) has a network layer
      and uses the network layer protocol
  - Receiving side, unpackages the segment

  - Key network layer functions
    - Forwarding
      - Deciding what to do with packets when you receive them (where should I forward
        it to, or to application layer if it's meant for me)
      - Data Plane (determines how datagram arriving on input port is forward to
        router output port)
    - Routing
      - Determines the end to end route taken by packets
      - Routing algorithms exchange info between networking devices, and this allows
        routers to create the forwarding table and routing table
      - Control plane (populate forwarding table)
        - Determine how datagram routed among routers along end-end path
          from source to destination
        - Approaches: traditional routing algorithms, software-defined networking
        - Most control plane packets are actually data plane packets (hop to hop packets)
        - Logically centralized control plane -> Control agent that exchanges info
          with remote controller
          - Used within each subnetwork on the Internet, not necessary private networks

Routers
  - Who is responsible for routers?
    - Backbone providers, Tier 1 ISP's
  - Router processor (contains forwarding table) and high-seed switching fabric
    (which does the packet switching)
  - Packet queueing on the input port
  - Forwarding
    - Destination-based: Based on destination IP address of packet, it knows
      which output port to forward it to
      - Longest prefix matching (forward to the longest number of bits that match
        between destination IP and forwarding table entry, i.e highest specificity)
    - Generalized: Forward based on any set of header field values
  - Switching fabrics
    - Transfer packet from input buffer to appropriate output buffer
    - Memory switching (first gen routers), stored in system memory
      - Advantage: Very simple to implement
      - Disadvantage: Speed limited by memory bandwidth, can't read and write
        to RAM at the same time
    - Bus switching
      - Shared bus with very fast speed.
      - Disadvantage: However, only one datagram can use the bus at a time
      - Not really used anymore
    - Crossbar (interconnection network)
      - Does not have the bandwidth limitations that the bus has
    - If fabric is slower than input ports combined, then queueing will occur
      - Head of line blocking (queued datagram at front prevents others in queue
        from moving forward)
  - Output ports
    - Amount of memory doesn't not translate into more spots because the packets take
      up space
    - Priority scheduling: Whoever gets highest priority (up to implementation)

QOS, time scale trade off
  - Ranking traffic, may be an issue if another router prioritizes a completely
    different set of traffic
  - Reserve capacity (can prioritize plannable use applications such as telesurgery)
