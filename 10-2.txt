DNS
  - LDNS - Local DNS server (aka recursive resolver)
  - Distributed database over many name servers
    - Hierarchical
      - Root DNS Servers
        -> com/org/edu DNS servers (TLD server -- Top Level Domain)
          -> yahoo/amazon/pbs/etc servers (Authoritative server)
            - The authoritative server is the "authority" over the data that's on it
            - If authoritative server changes, root doesn't need to know about that
              only the TLD server would need to know
    - Root servers
      - IP address of these servers don't change at all
      - Their IP's are stored in local ISP's resolvers
      - Some are operated by government, some by orgs, edus, and for profit companies
    - TLD Servers
      - VeriSign maintains servers for .com TLD
      - Educause for .edu TLD
    - Authoritative DNS
      - Organizations own their own DNS server mapping organizational hostname to IP addresses
      - Authoritative resolvers needed to redirect mail to mail servers
      - Can also be maintained by a service provider rather than the organization
      - Can have multiple levels depending on complexity (multiple authoritative levels
        where the top would return IP address to the next level authoritative server)
    - Local DNS name server
      - Does not belong to hierarchy
      - ISP's have one
  - DNS is Application layer protocol to resolve names
  - Iterated query to resolve the IP (hits root, then hits TLD ip, then authoritative)
  - Caching
    - Once any name server learns mapping, it caches the mapping with an expiration date
    - If name host changes IP address, may not be known Internet-wide until all TTLs expires
  - DNS Records
    - A (name -> IPv4 address)
    - AAAA (name -> IPv6 address)
    - NS (name -> authoritative name server that contains this domain)
    - CNAME (name [could be alias] -> canonical name [the real name])
    - MX (name -> name of mail-server associated with name)

    - UPDATING RECORDS
      - Register with DNS registrar (name, two authoritative name servers, IP, A)
      - Registrar creates authoritative server type A record and MX record
  - DNS Protocol
    - Query and replies have the same message Format
      - ID number
      - Flags

  - Attacks
    - DDOS (attacking root and TLD servers)
    - Redirect attacks
      - DNS poisoning (send bogus replies to DNS server, which gets cached)

====== P2P Architecture

P2P
  - No always on server (in the most pure P2P architecture -- in reality there is some small infrastructure of always on servers)
  - Arbitrary end systems directly communicate
  - Peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses
  - File distribution
    - In client-server model: Server will send a copy of file to each peer who wants it
  - BitTorrent
    - Tracker will note a person's neighbors
    - Running into churn (once someone is done getting the file they leave)
    - Read the slide for tit for tat
