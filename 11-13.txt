BGP
  - UPDATE will automatically withdraw the old path
  - When router learns multiple paths to a destination, it depends on whatever
    policy is configured on the router to choose which path it wants to choose
    - Once a router learns and chooses a route, it advertises it via iBGP
      (and doesn't advertise the other route(s))
  - iBGP sessions exist between any two routers in the same AS, not just
    your nearest neighbor
  - NEXT-HOP v1
    - Because of iBGP, 2a will learn a route to 2c even if it's not directly connected,
      because a TCP connection will be established
    - This is why 1A's NEXT-HOP is 1c
    - Stitching together the NEXT-HOP's creates the forwarding route
  - NEXT-HOP v2
    - NEXT-HOP will be the previous border router
    - 3a's IP address will be in the subnet of AS2 in order to be on the same
      wavelength for communication

AS Types
  - Multi-homes: Effectively a stub. In the slide, AS2 may get some traffic from AS1
    and AS3 and may send stuff to AS1 and AS3, but will not deliver traffic from
    AS1 to AS3 or vise versa

No Valley
  - Why? You pay money for both ways but don't benefit
  - Export policy: To peer/provider only export routes learned from customers or internally
